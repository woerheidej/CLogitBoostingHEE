\usage{

  data,
  exposure = NULL,
  response = "resp",
  strata = "strata",
  outcome = "y",
  matching = "s",
  include_interactions = TRUE,
  df_bols = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the response, exposure, strata,
matching variables, and covariates.}

\item{exposure}{Character string giving the name of the exposure
variable. If supplied and \code{include_interactions = TRUE},
interactions between the exposure and all other covariates are added.}

\item{response}{Character string giving the name of the response
tuple used on the left-hand side of the formula (default: \code{"resp"}).}

\item{strata}{Character string giving the name of the strata variable.
This variable is excluded from the set of predictors.}

\item{outcome}{Character string giving the name of the outcome variable.
This variable is excluded from the predictor set.}

\item{matching}{Character vector of variable names used for matching.
These variables are excluded from the predictor set.}

\item{include_interactions}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, include interaction
terms between the exposure and all other covariates.}

\item{df_bols}{Integer specifying the degrees of freedom for linear
base learners (\code{bols}).}

\item{df_bbs}{Integer specifying the degrees of freedom for smooth
base learners (\code{bbs}).}

\item{intercept}{Logical. Whether linear base learners should include
an intercept term (usually \code{FALSE} for boosting).}

\item{center}{Logical. Whether continuous covariates should be centered
in smooth base learners.}

\item{flexible}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, both linear and smooth base
learners are included for continuous covariates; otherwise, only
linear base learners are used.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{form}{A model formula suitable for \code{mboost::gamboost}.}
\item{all_terms}{A character vector of all base learner terms used
to construct the formula.}
}
}
\description{
Programmatically builds a model formula for component-wise gradient
boosting using linear (\code{bols}) and optional smooth (\code{bbs})
base learners. Optionally includes exposure–covariate interaction
terms to enable detection of heterogeneous exposure effects.

\title{Detect constant or singular columns (including interactions) per fold}
\usage{
detect_singular_cols(
  data_proc,
  exposure,
  response,
  outcome,
  strata,
  folds,
  sampling_type = "SS"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_proc}{Data frame containing the preprocessed dataset.}

\item{exposure}{Character name of exposure variable.}

\item{response}{Character name of response variable.}

\item{strata}{Character name of strata variable.}

\item{folds}{Binary matrix of complementary folds (rows = obs, cols = folds).}

\item{sampling_type}{Character string specifying the stability selection
scheme: \code{"SS"} for Shah & Samworth complementary pairs stability
selection or \code{"MB"} for the original Meinshausen & Bühlmann approach
(default \code{"SS"}).}
}
\value{
Character vector of column names that are constant in at least one fold.
}
\description{
Checks each variable (and its interaction with exposure) for being constant
within complementary folds. Works for numeric, factor, and mixed variables.
